### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is a part of my story,
I met Python and fell in love with, 
I like problem solving, so my main tool became Python and its frameworks 
I started working on different projects including backend programming and scientific programming, but I have found that I'm more of a problem solver than a programmer
Then I found out that I like art and story telling. 
Thanks GOD I'v met Data Science. So I can have all those together. So I started studying topics, and I came back here to share my tools and my path, as well. 
So, that's it. :)
